FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](#performance).

* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. <abbr title="also known as auto-complete, autocompletion, IntelliSense">Completion</abbr> everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.





* Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    * Swagger UI.
    * ReDoc.
